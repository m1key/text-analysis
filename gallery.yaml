            Perhaps the best way to understand individual countries, and in Eastern Europe even more so than elsewhere, is to understand their history.

            In Poland, we like to boast that Poland was off the maps for 123 years, and yet it managed to come back to life and gain independence, after all. It turns out that Bulgaria survived half a millennium under foreign occupation, and yet it stood the test of time, and preserved its identity.

        - title: Welcome to Bulgaria
          fileNameContains: DSCF6182.jpg
          description: |
                The spirit of Bulgaria is said to have survived the Ottoman occupation in secluded places just like this one. Far away from the imperial hustle and bustle, Bulgarian identity was nourished in distant monasteries, where Bulgarian language and the Cyrillic alphabet were preserved for future use. That time came in the 19th century.
        - title: Sofia
          fileNameContains: DSCF5988.jpg
          description: |
                But the hopes of long lasting independence were soon to be squashed. Although it too is a Balkan country, Bulgaria never was part of Yugoslavia. Instead, it was a Soviet satellite country.<br />In 1989, Bulgaria became independent and democratic at last, but in the elections that shortly followed, the Communists triumphed again, albeit under a new name of Bulgarian Socialist Party. Nevertheless, the country has become a NATO and EU member.

          description: |
                Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, is ancient. This is the oldest surviving building, the Byzantine Church of St. George, surrounded by Socialist edifices. [2]<br />I get criticised all the time for using the word Socialist like that (&quot;Canada and Denmark are Socialist!&quot;), but that's the official name of this architectural style and that's what the Communist states called themselves. [3]

          fileNameContains: DJI_0016-Edit.jpg
          description: |
                To give you a sense of how surrounded it is, I threw my camera very high up in the air... Okay, I flew my drone. It turns out Bulgaria is nowhere near as paranoid about drones as other countries, and on top of that, I was accompanied by my friend Sasho and his mighty press card.
        - title: Serdica
          fileNameContains: DSCF6034.jpg
          description: |
                And to give you an idea of how ancient Sofia is, there are ancient Roman ruins for you to see. That's right, if you've ever played Total War, you might have conquered Serdica - that's the ancient Roman city that became Sofia. In fact, the city was originally a Thracian settlement, and then it was possessed by Alexander the Great, destroyed by the Huns... Lots of history here.

          fileNameContains: DSCF6068.jpg
          description: |
                According to my guide book, if you're a Tin Tin fan, you'll recognise these guys.<br />Because I used a very short lens on this trip, I needed to get really close to this chap to take this photo. I used the fact that they cannot speak and tell you off, heh heh. What happened was, the other soldier scared me with his rifle, and then I was chased away by another guy with a whistle. Gee, sorry!
        - title: Martenitsa
          fileNameContains: DSCF6015.jpg
          description: |
                The Bulgarians celebrate Poland... No, they don't, but that's what I first thought. This adornment is called martenitsa, red representing female, white representing male, but then there are various interpretations as well. Either way, this is how the Bulgarians welcome spring. Reminds me of the Japanese Hinamatsuri.
        - title: National Ethnology Museum
          fileNameContains: DSCF6082.jpg
          description: |
                Sofia has certain elegance to it. This is the formal Royal Palace which has now become the National Ethnology Museum.
        - title: Striptease Bar Kiss
          fileNameContains: DSCF6108.jpg
          description: |
                Well yeah, maybe not everything is elegant! Like other big cities in Eastern Europe, Sofia has become a target location for the infamous British stag do parties, binge drinking and striptease fun.
        - title: National Archaeological Museum
          fileNameContains: DSCF6077-Edit.jpg
          description: |
                This is the National Archaeological Museum. I asked my friend Ilinka to sit on the bench to improve the composition of the image. Just when it was perfect, the guy in the front leaned forward to show off his ass... Photography is difficult, man.<br />Anyway, looking at the architecture of this building you might be able to guess its original purpose. That's right, it used to be a mosque.

                Fun fact: In Persian, octopus is called &quot;eight-legged&quot;. I sometimes address my Persian teacher as &quot;two-legged&quot;. She hates it.

          fileNameContains: DSCF6030.jpg
          description: |
                Everyone in Bulgaria smokes! So annoying. And they smoke everywhere. But then it turns out that about 2 months after I visited a smoking ban was introduced.

          fileNameContains: DSCF6052-Edit.jpg
          description: |
                The Chupa Chups logo was designed in 1969 by the artist Salvador Dalí. [4]
        - title: Alexander Nevsky Cathedral
          fileNameContains: DJI_0003-Edit.jpg
          description: |
                Unlike many other Eastern European countries, Bulgaria appears to have had a rather cordial relationship with Russia. They share the alphabet (actually a Bulgarian creation!), religion (Orthodox Christianity), and then the Russians helped out to free Bulgaria from the Ottoman yoke. Hence this cathedral was named after a Russian Saint and prince, and it was created in honour to the Russian soldiers who died during the Russo-Turkish War. [5]<br />Perhaps in recognition of Jesus' modesty, the cathedral is decorated with Italian marble in various colours, Brazilian onyx, alabaster, and other luxurious materials.

          description: |
                &quot;And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.&quot; -- Matthew 21:12-13.

        - title: Rila Monastery
          fileNameContains: DSCF6118.jpg
          description: |
                This is the fabulous Monastery of Saint Ivan of Rila. It's one of the most famous landmarks in Bulgaria, and almost one million people visit every year. It is thought of as a depository of Bulgarian language and culture, as well as a hideout for various Bulgarian revolutionaries during the Ottoman occupation. Curiously, I read somewhere that even the Ottoman Sultan donated some money to it to have it restored. Little did he know...
        - title: Rila Monastery from Above
          fileNameContains: DJI_0042-Edit.jpg
          description: |
                The oldest part of the monastery is the tall Tower of Hrelja. As you can see, the place used to be completely secluded, and the monks would only very rarely interact with the outside. Architecturally, the main building resembles mosques also found in this part of the world.
        - title: Ablaq
          fileNameContains: DSCF6129-Edit.jpg
          description: |
                And then this is ablaq - the stripes that is. The stripes became popular in the Ottoman Empire (that Bulgaria was part of) following the conquest of Egypt.

          description: |
                Saint Ivan of Rila was a proper hermit though. He didn't live in that fancy monastery. Let's fly to where he lived!
        - title: The Path
          fileNameContains: DSCF6150.jpg
          description: |
                Of course we don't have to fly. The place used to be remote and distant, but now there's a road that ends with a parking and this path. On our way back, we picked up some pilgrims in a rush, and they gave us their blessing afterwards.

                There is a cave here, and only those who are not major sinners can squeeze through, they say.

                Maybe something was lost in translation, but I was told a hermit lived here now as well. Another one.

          description: |
                If you're visiting Rila, this is probably worth seeing. These are the Stob's Pyramids. They should not be confused with the Melnik ones. Made of clay and river sand, some up to 40 metres tall.<br />Of course, there are many legends associated with them, including one about a local Turkish boy and Bulgarian girl, whose love was not to be due to religious differences - in despair, she jumped off the cliff and became a pyramid.

          description: |
                Who would have thought that one of the world's best-preserved ancient theatres would be in Bulgaria? It's existed for almost 2000 years, and it's still in use, following restoration. [7]
        - title: Plovdiv
          fileNameContains: DSCF6231-Edit.jpg
          description: |
                Plovdiv is also ancient - there's supposedly evidence of habitation since the 6th millennium BC. Like Sofia, it was originally a Thracian settlement, and then it was invaded by pretty much everyone, from Persians to Goths to Huns to Crusaders to Turks.

          description: |
                I was amazed that the front of this mosque (Dzhumaya Mosque) was some sort of café. Islam is the largest minority religion in Bulgaria, and predates even the Ottoman invasion. Of course once Bulgaria became part of the Ottoman Empire, there were reasons to convert to Islam in order to be a first-class citizen. Interestingly, some Muslims in the Ottoman Empire converted or pretended they converted to Christianity so that their sons would have a chance to become a member of the elite and influential corps of Janissaries.<br />This mosque was attacked by a mob in 2014.

                &quot;On September 30, 2016, the Parliament of Bulgaria, backed by the Patriotic Front passed the law that outlaws wearing burqas by women in public places in an effort to combat terrorism and migrants flowing through Europe.&quot;<br />0.5 percent of Bulgarian Muslims believe that disputes should be resolved using Islamic Sharia law - in Britain, 40% accept &quot;some aspects&quot; of it.<br />In the picture, the Imaret Mosque that sports a unique minaret, and the unofficial flag of Eastern Europe - shopping bag caught in a tree.

                Nebet Tepe was where the citadel of the ancient town was. What you see in the photo is from the time of Justinian. If Nebet Tepe sounds Turkish to you, that's because it is. It means &quot;the hill of the guards&quot;.<br />... And so much for Bulgaria part 1! I must say we had a pretty good time, it was safe and clean, and there were diverse food options.<br />Give me some time now, and I'll bring you part 2. We'll go to Buzludzha the Spaceship and to Veliko Tarnovo.
