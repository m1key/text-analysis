# Text Analysis

Sandbox Python project for some text stats. Will be applied to my gallery yaml
files.

## Setup

Using Python 2. Only `mining.py` requires Anaconda.

Actually, maybe use easy_install? No sudo required.

`pip install textstat`

`pip install nltk`

`>>> import nltk`

`>>> nltk.download('punkt')`

`>>> nltk.download('english')`

`pip install textblob`

`pip install pyaml`

### Setup for Anaconda

If Anaconda is installed, the following must run.

`conda install -c conda-forge textblob`

`conda install -c mlgill textstat`

## Simple run

This will analyse a local file.

`python analyse.py`

## Analyse All Galleries

This will analyse all galleries, assuming they are under the default directory.
It will write statistics for each gallery.

`python analyse_all.py`

Make it verbose to see problems:

`python analyse_all.py -v`

You can store the output as CSV:

`python analyse_all.py -o /tmp/galleries.csv`

Use `--help` for all options.

`python analyse_all.py --help`

## Mining

This will do some Pandas data mining on the file generated by the previous
script.

## Analyse All As One

This will analyse all galleries as one text corpus.

`python analyse_all.py`

## Difficulty Analyser

Unlike other algorithms here, this will make an API call to analyse the
difficulty of each word separately.

## Tests

This will run basic methods against a static text.

`python tests.py`
